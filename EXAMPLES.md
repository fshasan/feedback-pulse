### Negative Feedback

**Customer Support:**
```
We keep hitting rate limits on the API. The current 1000 requests per hour is way too low for our use case. This is blocking our production deployment. Please increase the limits or provide a way to request higher quotas.
```

**Discord:**
```
Getting SSL certificate errors when trying to connect. Is this a known issue? Super urgent, our service is down and we can't process any requests.
```

**GitHub:**
```
Experiencing memory leaks in production. Memory usage grows from 200MB to 2GB over 24 hours. Needs urgent attention. This is affecting our entire infrastructure.
```

**Twitter/X:**
```
@CloudflareAPI experiencing massive slowdowns today. Response times are 5x normal. Anyone else seeing this? Our users are complaining about the performance issues.
```

**Email:**
```
Our billing seems incorrect this month. We were charged $500 more than expected. Can someone review this? We need clarification on the pricing structure.
```

**Forum:**
```
The dashboard takes over 10 seconds to load. This has been happening for the past week. Very frustrating for our team. Is there a known issue or workaround?
```

### Neutral Feedback / Feature Requests

**Customer Support:**
```
Can we get automatic retries for failed webhooks? Right now if a webhook fails once, it never retries. We miss important notifications and have to manually retry them.
```

**Discord:**
```
Would love to see GraphQL subscription support. This is a must-have for our real-time application. Currently using workarounds but native support would be ideal.
```

**GitHub:**
```
The TypeScript definitions are missing several new endpoints. Please update @types/cloudflare to match the latest API. This would help with type safety in our codebase.
```

**Twitter/X:**
```
Love the product but pricing is getting steep. The new tier structure makes it hard for small teams to afford. Hope you reconsider the pricing model.
```

**Email:**
```
We're interested in enterprise features like SSO and advanced security options. Could someone from sales reach out to discuss our requirements?
```

**Forum:**
```
What are the recommended cache headers for static assets? Looking for best practices from the community. We want to optimize our caching strategy.
```

### High Urgency / Critical Issues

```
URGENT: Our production API is completely down. All requests are failing with 500 errors. This is blocking all our customers. Need immediate assistance!
```

**Discord:**
```
CRITICAL: Data leak detected! User data is being exposed in API responses. This is a security issue that needs immediate attention. Please escalate ASAP.
```

**GitHub:**
```
Production outage! The service has been unavailable for the past 2 hours. Error logs show database connection failures. This is affecting thousands of users.
```

**Email:**
```
BLOCKER: We cannot deploy our application due to rate limiting issues. The current limits are too restrictive for our production workload. This is blocking our release.
```

---

```
The API response times have increased significantly over the past week. What used to take 100ms now takes over 2 seconds. This is impacting our user experience.
```

```
Noticing slow query performance in the dashboard. Complex queries that used to be instant now take 5-10 seconds. Is there a known performance issue?
```

```

**Discord:**
```
SSL certificate validation is failing for some of our domains. Getting certificate errors that prevent secure connections. Need help resolving this.
```

**Email:**
```
We need to implement SAML SSO for our organization. Can you provide guidance on setting this up? Security is a top priority for us.

The API documentation is missing examples for the new webhook endpoints. Could you add code samples for Python and Node.js? This would help us integrate faster.
```
